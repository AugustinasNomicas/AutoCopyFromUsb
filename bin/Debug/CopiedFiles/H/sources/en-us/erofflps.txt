WHAT THIS FEATURE DOES

The Microsoft Error Reporting Service helps Microsoft and Microsoft partners diagnose problems in the software you use and provide solutions. Not all problems have solutions, but when solutions are available, they are offered as steps to solve a problem you’ve reported or as updates to install. To help prevent problems and make software more reliable, some solutions are also included in service packs and future versions of the software.

The Microsoft Error Reporting Service also provides Setup Repair, an error reporting service that may run during Windows setup if a problem occurs.

INFORMATION COLLECTED, PROCESSED, OR TRANSMITTED

Many Microsoft software programs, including Windows 7, are designed to work with the reporting service. If a problem occurs in one of these software programs, you might be asked if you want to report it.  If you host virtual machines using a Windows operating system, reports generated by the Windows operating system for the Microsoft Error Reporting Service might include information about virtual machines. 

The reporting service collects information that is useful for diagnosing and solving the problem that has occurred, such as:

  *  Where the problem happened in the software or hardware
  *  The type or severity of the problem
  *  Files that help describe the problem
  *  Basic software and hardware information
  *  Possible software performance and compatibility problems 

These reports might unintentionally contain personal information. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of computer memory might include your name, part of a document you were working on, or data that you recently submitted to a website. If a report is likely to contain this type of information, Windows will ask if you want to send this information, even if you have enabled automatic reporting through the “Recommended settings” option in setup, or Control Panel. This gives you the opportunity to review the report before sending it to Microsoft. Reports including files and data might be stored on your computer until you have an opportunity to review and send them, or after they have been sent.

If an error report contains personal information, Microsoft does not use the information to identify you or contact you. In addition, if you enable automatic reporting through the "Recommended settings" option in setup, or in Control Panel, the reporting service will send basic information about where problems occur automatically, but these reports will not have the detail described above.

After you send a report, the reporting service might ask you for more information about the error you experienced. If you choose to provide your phone number or e-mail address in this information, your error report will be personally identifiable. Microsoft might contact you to request additional information to help solve the problem you reported.

The Microsoft Error Reporting Service generates a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is stored on your computer and sent with error reports to uniquely identify your computer. The GUID is a randomly generated number; it does not contain any personal information and is not used to identify you. We use the GUID to distinguish how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between one customer experiencing a problem one hundred times and one hundred customers experiencing the same problem once.

USE OF INFORMATION

Microsoft uses information about errors and problems to improve Microsoft products and services as well as third-party software and hardware designed for use with these products and services. Microsoft employees, contractors, vendors, and partners might be provided access to information collected by the reporting services. However, they will use the information only to repair or improve Microsoft products and services and third-party software and hardware designed for use with Microsoft products and services.

Microsoft might share aggregate information about errors and problems. Microsoft uses aggregate information for statistical analysis. Aggregate information does not contain specific information from individual reports, nor does it include any personal or confidential information that might have been collected from a report.

Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as performing statistical analysis. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Microsoft may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the software; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.

Information collected by or sent to Microsoft by Windows 7 may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

CHOICE AND CONTROL

If you choose the recommended settings during Windows 7 setup, basic information about errors will be sent automatically to Microsoft. If a more detailed error report is required, you will be prompted to review it before it is sent. You can change this setting at any time by going to Action Center in Control Panel.

SECURITY PRACTICES

Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.
